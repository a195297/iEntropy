Executable file is a portable version which do not support 3D illustration. Please check README.md to experience full version.

Those who want to use complete edition with 3D lattice structure visualization should download the code in github and install the package by themselves. The source code in github is full version.
It is very easy. Just install it with following steps.

Python version: Python 3.9.6

please install two package with following pip command

ase

    pip install ase

To use the visualization function, you need to uncomment just two line code in the main.py.

Hope you enjoy iEntropy!!
